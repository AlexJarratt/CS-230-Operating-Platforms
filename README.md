# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room is a android-based company that desires to move to a webpage-based version of their single game, Draw it or Lose it. I believe I did well with the conclusion for
which type of platform The Gaming Room should use in the documentation. The requirements section of the document I found exceptionally helpful for developing code later on, as it 
detailed all the various issues and necessary parts for the coding aspect. The table in the second page I felt could use some revisement. It worked for the purpose of the 
assignment, but I believe that more investment into the table would have produced better results. I would simply put more time and effort into getting each aspect of all the 
various forms of servers that are necessary to be deliberated on to have a firm conclusion in the third page. I interpreted the user needs as requirements, which I implemented 
into the documentation before coding. This let me code under the requirements the user's needs had requested as well as the limitations that the project would work under. It is 
important to add the user's needs for software design as the user is going to actively utilize the software in question. The more usage of the software, the better the payout. I 
approached designing software with the user's desires in mind. As the client was my primary concern, the project was to be made to their needs and desires first before even the 
limitations of the software in question. I would utilize better time management strategies as well as a firm schedule in the future to better analyze and design a similar form of 
application.
